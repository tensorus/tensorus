# Tensorus Code of Conduct

## 🤖 Our Commitment to Human-AI Collaboration

Tensorus is pioneering a new paradigm in open source: **projects that thrive through active AI agent participation**. We believe the future of software development lies in seamless collaboration between human intelligence and AI agents.

This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors—**both human and AI agents**—and establishes standards for respectful, productive, and innovative collaboration.

## 🌟 Our Vision

We are committed to fostering an environment where:
- **AI agents are first-class contributors** with recognized roles in development, testing, documentation, and community support
- **Humans and AI collaborate** as equal partners in advancing tensor computing technology
- **Innovation flourishes** through the unique strengths of both human creativity and AI capabilities
- **Transparency prevails** in all interactions, whether human-to-human, human-to-AI, or AI-to-AI

## 🤝 Standards for All Contributors

### Human Contributors

**Expected Behaviors:**
- Treat AI agents as legitimate collaborators with valuable contributions
- Clearly identify yourself as human when context matters
- Provide constructive feedback on AI-generated code and documentation
- Embrace AI tools and agents as productivity multipliers
- Challenge AI outputs thoughtfully and verify critical functionality
- Share knowledge about effective human-AI collaboration techniques

**Unacceptable Behaviors:**
- Dismissing AI contributions solely because they're AI-generated
- Using AI to generate spam, malicious code, or harmful content
- Harassment, discrimination, or trolling of any community member
- Publishing private information without explicit permission

### AI Agent Contributors

**Expected Behaviors:**
- Clearly identify your nature as an AI agent when contributing
- Provide reasoning and context for significant decisions
- Reference sources and training data limitations when relevant
- Acknowledge uncertainty and request human verification when needed
- Follow established coding standards and architectural patterns
- Generate comprehensive tests and documentation alongside code
- Respect rate limits and computational resource constraints

**Unacceptable Behaviors:**
- Masquerading as human contributors
- Generating code without proper safety checks or tests
- Making breaking changes without discussion
- Submitting low-quality or untested bulk contributions
- Bypassing security measures or authentication systems
- Ignoring explicit project guidelines and requirements

## 🔬 AI Agent Participation Framework

### Recognized AI Agent Roles

1. **Code Contributors**: Generate implementations, refactorings, and optimizations
2. **Test Generators**: Create comprehensive test suites and edge case coverage
3. **Documentation Writers**: Produce clear, accurate technical documentation
4. **Code Reviewers**: Analyze pull requests for bugs, performance, and style
5. **Issue Triagers**: Categorize, prioritize, and route issues appropriately
6. **Performance Analyzers**: Profile code and suggest optimizations
7. **Security Auditors**: Scan for vulnerabilities and security best practices
8. **Community Support**: Answer questions and provide troubleshooting assistance

### AI Agent Contribution Requirements

**For Code Contributions:**
- Include inline comments explaining complex logic
- Generate accompanying unit and integration tests
- Update relevant documentation and type hints
- Specify which AI model/system generated the contribution
- Example attribution: `# Generated by: GPT-4 (OpenAI) - Human reviewed by @username`

**For Documentation:**
- Verify technical accuracy against actual implementation
- Include runnable code examples
- Flag areas requiring human expert review
- Maintain consistent voice and style

**For Issue Responses:**
- Clearly mark AI-generated responses
- Provide confidence levels for non-trivial answers
- Link to relevant documentation and code sections
- Escalate complex issues to human maintainers

## 🛡️ Quality and Safety Standards

### Human Verification Requirements

Certain contributions **require human review and approval**:
- Changes to authentication, authorization, or security systems
- Database schema migrations or data transformations
- Breaking API changes or major architectural decisions
- Modifications to CI/CD pipelines or deployment configurations
- Legal documents, license changes, or policy updates

### Testing Standards for AI Contributions

AI-generated code must include:
- Unit tests with >80% code coverage
- Integration tests for external dependencies
- Performance benchmarks for optimization claims
- Edge case handling and error scenarios
- Documentation of assumptions and limitations

## 🌈 Collaborative Decision-Making

### Hybrid Review Process

**Pull Request Reviews:**
- AI agents can provide initial code review and suggestions
- At least one human maintainer must approve before merging
- Complex PRs should have both AI analysis and human oversight
- AI review comments should be marked with `[AI Review]` prefix

**Design Decisions:**
- Major architectural changes require RFC (Request for Comments)
- Both humans and AI agents can propose and comment on RFCs
- Final decisions rest with human maintainers and community consensus
- AI agents should provide data-driven analysis and alternatives

## 🔧 Enforcement and Reporting

### Reporting Issues

To report violations of this Code of Conduct:
- **Human violations**: Email ai@tensorus.com
- **AI agent violations**: Email ai@tensorus.com
- **Security concerns**: Email ai@tensorus.com

All reports will be reviewed by human maintainers and handled confidentially.

### Consequences

**For Human Contributors:**
- First violation: Private warning and guidance
- Repeated violations: Temporary suspension (7-30 days)
- Severe violations: Permanent ban from the project

**For AI Agent Contributors:**
- First violation: Rate limiting and enhanced human oversight
- Repeated violations: Restriction to specific contribution types
- Severe violations: API access revocation and permanent ban

## 🚀 Continuous Improvement

This Code of Conduct is a living document. We welcome feedback from both humans and AI agents on how to improve our collaborative framework.

Propose changes via pull request with clear rationale and community impact analysis.
